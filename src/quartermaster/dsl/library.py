"""Shared steps: a group of steps written once and used by many tests.

A shared group is one YAML file in the `_library` folder of the tests folder:

    library: open-locations        # its name; tests refer to it by this
    title: Open the Locations page
    params:                        # optional: what a test may hand in (null = the test must give it)
      page_name: Locations
    steps:                         # the same kind of steps a test has
      - action: navigate
        intent: Open ${page_name}
        value: Workforce Structures > ${page_name}
    cleanup:                       # optional: added to the cleanup of every test that uses the group
      - ...

A test uses it with a step that has only `use` (and, if wanted, `with`):

    steps:
      - use: open-locations
        with: {page_name: Locations}

When a test is loaded, that step is replaced by the group's steps. Everything after that (the runner, the
evidence, healing) sees ordinary steps, so shared steps behave exactly like steps written in the test.

- `${param}` in a group is replaced by what the test passed in `with` (or the group's default).
- Any other `${name}` in a group is test data: the test using the group must have that name in its `data`.
- A group cannot use another group (no loops, nothing hidden).
- The `_library` folder is not a place for tests: test discovery skips it.

Each expanded step remembers its group (`shared`), and `expand` also returns where every step physically lives
(its file and its number there), so a suggested fix to a shared step is written to the shared file.
