"""Suggest a fix for a step whose item was not found on the screen.

When every way a test knows to find something fails (Oracle renamed a button, say), the step fails
as before. Afterwards, while the page is still open, two things are tried to find what it might
have become:

1. a name on the page that looks very like the old one ("Search by Name" for "Search: Name"): no
   AI, nothing leaves this computer;
2. only when an AI is set up in Settings: the AI is shown the step and the names of the buttons,
   links and fields on the screen (personal details masked, like in Prepare) and picks one, or says
   there is none.

Either way the result is only a *suggestion*: the step still fails, nothing is changed in the test,
and the choice is checked here (it must be found exactly once on the page, by the same code that
replays tests, and must not be a Save, Delete or similar button the step never mentions). A person
accepts or ignores it in Needs attention.
