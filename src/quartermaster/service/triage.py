"""Failure triage: the likely cause of a failed test, in plain words, and a draft Oracle service
request (SR) for the failures the quarterly update probably caused.

The cause is worked out from facts in the run history, never guessed by an AI:

    passed on an earlier release, fails on this one   the update probably changed something
    passed before on this same release                not the update: the data or the pod changed
    never passed                                      the test or its data, not Oracle

The SR draft is text for a person to read, change and paste into My Oracle Support.
Quartermaster never sends it anywhere.
