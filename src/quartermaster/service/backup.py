"""Backup and restore: one zip with everything that cannot be made again.

What goes in:

    tests/      the tests folder (the first client's tests, its recordings and manual scenarios)
    data/       the data folder (.qm): run history, imported manual scripts and release lists,
                schedules, audit log, settings, and the clients and their pods
    clients/    every other client's tests (and their evidence, when asked for)
    evidence/   the evidence folder, only when asked for (screenshots and videos can be large)

What never goes in: the passwords of the test users (they are removed from the copy of the pods
database), the key that protects them, and anything Quartermaster keeps in memory only (the AI key
and the sign-ins done by hand). So the zip is safe to keep in a shared folder. After a restore on
another computer, type the test users' passwords again; on the same computer they are kept.

Restoring replaces what is there, so it cannot be done while Quartermaster is running (its
databases are open). The web page therefore only stores the zip and asks for a restart, and the
next start applies it (`apply_pending`). Before anything is replaced, the current state is saved
as `data/backups/before-restore-<time>.zip`, so a restore can itself be undone.
